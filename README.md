# Enterprise Cybersecurity GRC Architecture Lab

This repository demonstrates the design and engineering of a full-scale enterprise cybersecurity Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) program aligned with NIST CSF, ISO 27001, SOC 2, and COBIT 2019.

The project simulates a real-world enterprise environment, covering governance architecture, risk management, compliance mapping, audit readiness, evidence automation, and executive cyber risk reporting.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Enterprise cybersecurity governance design  
- Cyber risk architecture & scoring models  
- Unified compliance framework engineering  
- Audit readiness & control testing workflows  
- Evidence automation pipelines  
- Executive risk dashboards & reporting  

## Architecture Overview

This project follows an enterprise-grade GRC operating model:

Governance → Risk Architecture → Compliance Architecture → Control Framework → Audit Readiness → Evidence Automation → Executive Reporting  

## Technology Stack

- Python  
- Excel / CSV  
- Cloud log simulations  
- Data visualization  
- Security & compliance frameworks  

## Outcome

This lab demonstrates how modern organizations can transform compliance from a static obligation into a dynamic, automated cyber risk management and assurance system.
